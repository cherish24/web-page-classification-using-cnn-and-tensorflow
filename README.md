#Web Page Classification Using CNN and Tensorflow

##Concept

The Web Text Classifier is a tool that attempts to categorize text scraped from a web page. Googleâ€™s TensorFlow has been used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and reliably associate a given snippet of web text (in a specified format) with a category. For example, if a snippet of text is taken from an online news outlet and provided to the Web Text Classifier it should categorize that data as News & Media. In the early stages of development, a minimal number of categories have been trained. The goal is to scale up the number of categories to potentially hundreds. Additionally, allowing a user of the Web Text Classifier to adjust the outcome of the categorization dynamically is a consideration.
